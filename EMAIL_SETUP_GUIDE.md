# üöÄ Quick Email Setup Guide

## Why Emails Aren't Being Sent Yet

Currently, newsletter subscriptions are only **logged to the console** instead of being sent as actual emails to `info@vaultmont.com`. This is because no email service has been configured yet.

## ‚ö° FASTEST SOLUTION: Web3Forms (FREE & 5-minute setup)

### Step 1: Get Web3Forms Access Key
1. Go to **https://web3forms.com/**
2. Click "**Get Started for Free**"
3. Sign up with your email

### Step 2: Configure Your Project
1. Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:
```env
NEWSLETTER_DESTINATION_EMAIL=info@vaultmont.com
WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key_here
```

2. Replace `your_access_key_here` with your actual Web3Forms access key

### Step 3: Test It!

## üìß What Happens After Setup

Once configured, when someone subscribes:

1. **Real email sent** to `info@vaultmont.com` with:
   - Subject: "Newsletter Subscription"
   - Subscriber's email address
   - Date and time
   - Source information

2. **Professional email template** with:
   - Vaultmont branding
   - Clear subscriber details
   - Next steps recommendations

3. **Console logging** continues for debugging

## üö® Current Status Check

Run this to see what's happening:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then check your terminal/console when someone subscribes. You'll see:
- ‚úÖ If email service is configured and working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è If only console logging is happening (no email service)
- ‚ùå If there are configuration errors

## üí° Pro Tips

- **Web3Forms** is recommended for simplicity and reliability
- All services have FREE tiers perfect for starting
- You can always upgrade or switch services later
- The system gracefully falls back to console logging if email fails

## üÜò Need Help?

1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Check your server terminal for logs  
3. Verify your `.env.local` file exists and has correct values
4. Test with a simple email like `test@example.com`

The system is designed to work even if email isn't configured - users will still get success messages, and you'll see all subscriptions in your console logs!
