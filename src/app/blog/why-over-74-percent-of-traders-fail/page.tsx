          Why Over 74% of Traders Fail | Pitfalls to Avoid (and What to Do Instead)
        </h1>
        <p className="text-base mb-6 text-gray-300 text-left">
          Here’s the uncomfortable truth: most retail traders don’t make money over time. European regulators report that between 74% and 89% of retail accounts lose money trading leveraged CFDs—a range repeated across multiple jurisdictions. Now, why does this happen—and how do you stay off that list?

          Pitfall 1: Trading Without a Real Edge
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base mb-6 text-gray-300 text-left">
          Clicking buy/sell isn’t an edge. An edge is a repeatable condition that, across a large sample, yields positive expectancy after costs. Many traders rely on hunches, social feeds, or one-off chart patterns that haven’t been tested. Decades of work on individual investors show that frequent, discretionary trading tends to underperform—partly due to poor security selection and partly due to costs.
          <br />
          Fix: Define one setup you can describe in one sentence. Backtest or forward-test it across 50–100 trades. If the math isn’t there, iterate the rules before you increase size.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-[#13db7a] text-left">
          Pitfall 2: Leverage Turns Small Errors Into Big Losses
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base mb-6 text-gray-300 text-left">
          Leverage accelerates outcomes—good and bad. It invites overconfidence and makes a normal losing streak feel catastrophic. Those high CFD loss rates regulators publish exist because of leverage interacting with human behavior.
          <br />
          Fix: Cap per-trade risk (e.g., a small, fixed % of equity). Set a daily stop (e.g., hit it, you’re done). If your strategy “only works” with big leverage, you don’t have a strategy yet.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-[#13db7a] text-left">
          Pitfall 3: Costs, Frictions, and Overtrading
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base mb-6 text-gray-300 text-left">
          Spreads, slippage, and commissions are silent killers. Research on retail trading shows that active traders often buy the wrong stocks and sell the right ones—and even when they’re “right,” costs erode edge.
          <br />
          Fix: Trade less, not more. Specialize in one market and a narrow time window where your setup performs best. If your edge dies after fees, simplify or step up in timeframe.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-[#13db7a] text-left">
          Pitfall 4: Process Confusion (Mixing Trading and Investing)
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base mb-6 text-gray-300 text-left">
          The fastest path to ruin is moving the goalposts: turning a losing trade into a “long-term investment,” or scalping your investment like a trade. The mind wants relief; the account needs discipline.
          <br />
          Fix: Label positions before entry: this is a trade (with stop/target) or an investment (with thesis/valuation band). Different rules, different horizons—never blur them mid-trade.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-[#13db7a] text-left">
          Pitfall 5: Emotional Execution (FOMO, Revenge, Freeze)
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base mb-6 text-gray-300 text-left">
          Under pressure, we don’t rise to our hopes; we fall to our training. After a win, traders get euphoric and oversize; after a loss, they chase or freeze. Studies of day trading communities show that persistence without adaptation mostly magnifies losses.
          <br />
          Fix: Pre-commit. Write your entry, exit, and invalidation before you click. If price hits your stop, you’re out—no second vote. Use a cooling-off rule after consecutive losses.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-[#13db7a] text-left">
          Pitfall 6: No Journal, No Feedback Loop
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base mb-6 text-gray-300 text-left">
          If you can’t say what your best trades have in common—or your worst—you’re flying blind. Without evidence, you’ll tweak rules emotionally and call it “refinement.”<br />
          Fix: Journal three things for every trade: the plan, what you actually did, and what you felt. Review weekly: keep what works, kill what doesn’t. Over time, this compounds skill, not just P/L.
        </p>

          Pitfall 7: Unrealistic Expectations and Sample Sizes
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base mb-6 text-gray-300 text-left">
          A handful of trades tells you nothing. The best papers show that performance stabilizes over large samples, and most active individuals underperform precisely because they never let a sober process play out.<br />
          Fix: Think in series, not single trades. Grade your month by rule-following and expectancy, not just net profit. Aim for “consistent process,” then scale only after you’ve proved it.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-[#13db7a] text-left">
          Bottom Line
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base mb-6 text-gray-300 text-left">
          Most traders fail not because markets are unbeatable, but because their process is. They use leverage without guardrails, trade without an edge, ignore costs, improvise under stress, and quit before a real sample size exists. The good news: each pitfall has a fix. Build a process you can repeat on a bad day. Protect your downside. Measure what matters. Do that, and you’ll already be in the minority that gives themselves a real chance to last.
